### Dependencies

These are the minimum dependencies required to build AcreetionOS Terminal, please note
that with some setups additional dependencies might be desired.

If you're running Wayland with an Nvidia GPU, you'll likely want the EGL
drivers installed too (these are called `libegl1-mesa-dev` on Ubuntu).

#### Debian/Ubuntu

If you'd like to build a local version manually, you need a few extra libraries
to build AcreetionOS Terminal. Here's an apt command that should install all of them. If
something is still found to be missing, please open an issue.

be missing, please open an issue.

```sh
sudo apk add cmake pkgconf freetype-dev fontconfig-dev python3 libxcb-dev
```

#### Windows

On windows you will need to have the `{architecture}-pc-windows-msvc` toolchain
installed as well as [Clang 3.9 or greater](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html).

#### Other

If you build AcreetionOS Terminal on another distribution, we would love some help
filling in this section of the README.

## Building

### Linux / Windows / BSD

```sh
cargo build --release
```

On Linux/BSD, if it is desired to build AcreetionOS Terminal without support for either the
X11 or Wayland rendering backend the following commands can be used.

```sh
# Force support for only Wayland
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features=wayland

# Force support for only X11
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features=x11
```

If all goes well, this should place a binary at `target/release/acreetionos-terminal`.

### macOS

```sh
make app
cp -r target/release/osx/AcreetionOS Terminal.app /Applications/
```

#### Universal Binary

The following will build an executable that runs on both x86 and ARM macos
architectures:

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin aarch64-apple-darwin
make app-universal
```

## Post Build

There are some extra things you might want to set up after installing AcreetionOS Terminal.
All the post build instruction assume you're still inside the AcreetionOS Terminal
repository.

### Terminfo

To make sure AcreetionOS Terminal works correctly, either the `acreetionos-terminal` or
`acreetionos-terminal-direct` terminfo must be used. The `acreetionos-terminal` terminfo will be
picked up automatically if it is installed.

If the following command returns without any errors, the `acreetionos-terminal` terminfo is
already installed:

```sh
infocmp acreetionos-terminal
```

If it is not present already, you can install it globally with the following
command:

```
sudo tic -xe acreetionos-terminal,acreetionos-terminal-direct extra/acreetionos-terminal.info
```

### Desktop Entry

Many Linux and BSD distributions support desktop entries for adding applications
to system menus. This will install the desktop entry for AcreetionOS Terminal:

```sh
sudo cp target/release/acreetionos-terminal /usr/local/bin # or anywhere else in $PATH
sudo cp extra/logo/acreetionos-terminal-term.svg /usr/share/pixmaps/AcreetionOS Terminal.svg
sudo desktop-file-install extra/linux/AcreetionOS Terminal.desktop
sudo update-desktop-database
```

If you are having problems with AcreetionOS Terminal's logo, you can replace it with
prerendered PNGs and simplified SVGs available in the `extra/logo/compat`
directory.

### Manual Page

Installing the manual page requires the additional dependencies `gzip` and `scdoc`.

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man5
scdoc < extra/man/acreetionos-terminal.1.scd | gzip -c | sudo tee /usr/local/share/man/man1/acreetionos-terminal.1.gz > /dev/null
scdoc < extra/man/acreetionos-terminal-msg.1.scd | gzip -c | sudo tee /usr/local/share/man/man1/acreetionos-terminal-msg.1.gz > /dev/null
scdoc < extra/man/acreetionos-terminal.5.scd | gzip -c | sudo tee /usr/local/share/man/man5/acreetionos-terminal.5.gz > /dev/null
scdoc < extra/man/acreetionos-terminal-bindings.5.scd | gzip -c | sudo tee /usr/local/share/man/man5/acreetionos-terminal-bindings.5.gz > /dev/null
```

### Shell completions

To get automatic completions for AcreetionOS Terminal's flags and arguments you can install the provided shell completions.

#### Zsh

To install the completions for zsh, you can place the `extra/completions/_acreetionos-terminal` file in any
directory referenced by `$fpath`.

If you do not already have such a directory registered through your `~/.zshrc`, you can add one like this:

```sh
mkdir -p ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zsh_functions
echo 'fpath+=${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zsh_functions' >> ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc
```

Then copy the completion file to this directory:

```sh
cp extra/completions/_acreetionos-terminal ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zsh_functions/_acreetionos-terminal
```

#### Bash

To install the completions for bash, you can `source` the `extra/completions/acreetionos-terminal.bash` file
in your `~/.bashrc` file.

If you do not plan to delete the source folder of acreetionos-terminal, you can run

```sh
echo "source $(pwd)/extra/completions/acreetionos-terminal.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Otherwise you can copy it to the `~/.bash_completion` folder and source it from there:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.bash_completion
cp extra/completions/acreetionos-terminal.bash ~/.bash_completion/acreetionos-terminal
echo "source ~/.bash_completion/acreetionos-terminal" >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### Fish

To install the completions for fish, from inside the fish shell, run

```
mkdir -p $fish_complete_path[1]
cp extra/completions/acreetionos-terminal.fish $fish_complete_path[1]/acreetionos-terminal.fish
```
